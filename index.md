**Abiola Adesanya - [Developing a Web-Based Historic Places Map: A Tool for Promoting Historic Preservation
and Tourism](https://abiolaaminat.github.io/LA558_Abiola_Adesanya/Finalproject/finalproject.html)**<br>
Historic landmarks and monuments are an important part of our cultural heritage, but
they can be difficult to discover and learn about. To promote historic preservation and tourism,
there is a need for tools that help people discover and explore historic places in their communities.
This project aims to develop a web-based historic places map that provides users with a visual
representation of the historic landmarks and monuments in Iowa State. The map will be created
using data from historic preservation organizations, government agencies, and museums. The tool
will allow users to explore and interact with data, including photographs. The goal of this project
is to promote historic preservation, tourism, and education by providing an interactive tool for
discovering and learning about historic places in Iowa State.

**Eunice Amissah-Mensah - [Assessing Homelessness in the United States](https://arabanyarkoa.github.io/LA558_Eunice_Amissah/?locale=en-us)**<br>
Homelessness is a complex issue that affects millions of people in the United States. It is caused by a combination of factors including poverty, lack of affordable housing, job loss, and mental illness. Homelessness disproportionately affects specific populations, such as veterans, families with children, and individuals experiencing chronic homelessness. The impact of homelessness extends beyond just housing insecurity, it affects physical and mental health, access to education and employment opportunities, and overall quality of life. Addressing homelessness requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that includes access to affordable housing, healthcare, education, and job training. Addressing homelessness is critical for ensuring the well-being and stability of individuals and communities. This project seeks to visualize places where categories of homelessness are prevalent with the help of Tableau.

**Farzan Faramarzi - [Wind Turbines history in USA and Iowa](https://farzanehf.github.io/LA-558/?locale=en-us)**<br>
Distraction accounts for 25% of the crashes in united states approximately. Influence of the wind turbine installations as a driver distraction on the number of crashes has been studied in this investigation. This issue is of prime importance for the state of Iowa as it has more than eight per cent of the total wind turbines install in USA. The crash database of the state of Iowa which correlates the crash number and severity to various contributing factors, in conjunction with the spatial data analysis have been used to better comprehend the location, time, quantity and severity of the occurring accidents and correlate it to the installed wind turbines for a particular region during a specific time frame. Analyzing this database for the years 2016 and 2018, has enabled us to better understand the influence of wind turbines installed during 2017 on the crash number. Various buffer values based on the driversâ€™ sight distance have been selected to better examine this influence. Interestingly, it was found that at the year 2018 (one year after installation of the wind turbines) the number of the crash cases were less than the year 2016 (the year before installation) at the same regions.

**Zahra Khalilzadeh - [Crop Yield Analysis](https://zahrakhalilzadeh.github.io/LA558_Zahra_Khalilzadeh/?locale=en-us)**<br>
The goal of this project is to develop a web map using R or Tableau to visualize crop yields in Iowa over time and identify factors that impact production such as soil quality and weather patterns. The project will use data analysis techniques to explore the correlation between crop yields and factors such as soil quality, weather patterns, and crop management practices. By creating a web map that displays crop yields across different counties in Iowa over time, the project aims to identify trends and patterns that could help farmers optimize their crop management practices. The project will also incorporate remote sensing technologies to monitor plant growth and health, as well as weather patterns, to predict pest and disease outbreaks and determine when and how much water to apply to different areas of the field.

**Samuel Odoom - [Alcohol Outlet Density and Violence in Des Moines: A Geospatial Approach](https://samod008.github.io/LA558_Samuel_Odoom/?locale=en-us)**<br>
To better understand the causes of urban crime and how to manage it, scholars have begun looking
into how the physical fabric of cities can create a conducive environment for crime and how these
physical environments can be altered to reduce crime. To achieve this, using geospatial tools has
become critical and helped bring new perspectives to scholarly ideas regarding the use of
geographic data in explaining social phenomena. This project aims to document the relationship
between alcohol outlet density and the incidence of crimes in Des Moines using a Geospatial
approach. By visualizing the location of liquor stores and crime incidences, this project seeks to
demonstrate that issues of alcohol availability and access are fundamental to the prevention of
crime-related problems within communities. 

**Hyunsik Son- [The U.S. Military Base Relocation and Its Impact on the Host Cities in South Korea](https://son1101.github.io/LA558_Son/?locale=en-us)**<br>
In 2002, the USFK and the South Korean governments agreed to consolidate and relocate U.S. military bases to a few large installations nationwide, with the relocation process beginning in 2005. This project focuses on examining how the relocation has affected two host cities, Dongducheon and Pyeongtaek. By analyzing the socioeconomic data of the two cities in 2007 and 2019, including factors such as physical environment, demography, and economy, the project aims to diagnose their current status in terms of urban decay. To achieve this goal, interactive web maps and various figures will be used to present the findings of the study.

**Xin Yan - [What data can help us estimate building heights at high resolution?](https://xinyan127.github.io/LA558_XinYan/?locale=en-us)**<br>
Building height is an important indicator for estimating energy consumption, material stock allocation, greenhouse gas emissions, urban heat island effects, distribution of population,and urban development plan. However, openly accessible building height information over large areas at high spatial resolution is still missing. To estimate the building height at a high accuracy, satellite data is the best choice to do that. Besides that, the building morphology also plays a big role. Different satellite data has various band setting, observation characteristics and research focus, the most important work is finding a set of stable features that help us build a model to estimate the building height. After having these features, we can easily predict the building height!
