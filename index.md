### Introduction
This repository includes the course materials for the LA 558 Spring 2023 Introduction to Web Mapping and Data Visualization course at [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu). This course is taught by [Professor Seeger](https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/cjseeger/).

The course explores the use and development of online mapping tools and coding to support a variety of activities. Topics include: spatial data science, participatory GIS, Volunteered Geographic Information, geodesign, data wrangling and sharing, user interface design and decision-making actions. 
Laboratory emphasis on practical applications and uses of Web GIS tools. The 2023 course emphasized the use of QGIS, GeoJSON.io, R (ggPlot2, Leaflet) and Tableau.

This course has a Prereq: CRP 451/551. GEOL 452/552 or instructor permission.


### Final projects from the course can be found below.

**Abiola Adesanya - [Developing a Web-Based Historic Places Map: A Tool for Promoting Historic Preservation
and Tourism](https://abiolaaminat.github.io/LA558_Abiola_Adesanya/Finalproject/finalproject.html)**<br>
Historic landmarks and monuments are an important part of our cultural heritage, but
they can be difficult to discover and learn about. To promote historic preservation and tourism,
there is a need for tools that help people discover and explore historic places in their communities.
This project aims to develop a web-based historic places map that provides users with a visual
representation of the historic landmarks and monuments in Iowa State. The map will be created
using data from historic preservation organizations, government agencies, and museums. The tool
will allow users to explore and interact with data, including photographs. The goal of this project
is to promote historic preservation, tourism, and education by providing an interactive tool for
discovering and learning about historic places in Iowa State.

**Eunice Amissah-Mensah - [Assessing Homelessness in the United States](https://arabanyarkoa.github.io/LA558_Eunice_Amissah/?locale=en-us)**<br>
Homelessness is a complex issue that affects millions of people in the United States. It is caused by a combination of factors including poverty, lack of affordable housing, job loss, and mental illness. Homelessness disproportionately affects specific populations, such as veterans, families with children, and individuals experiencing chronic homelessness. The impact of homelessness extends beyond just housing insecurity, it affects physical and mental health, access to education and employment opportunities, and overall quality of life. Addressing homelessness requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that includes access to affordable housing, healthcare, education, and job training. Addressing homelessness is critical for ensuring the well-being and stability of individuals and communities. This project seeks to visualize places where categories of homelessness are prevalent with the help of Tableau.

**Zahra Khalilzadeh - [Crop Yield Analysis](https://zahrakhalilzadeh.github.io/LA558_Zahra_Khalilzadeh/?locale=en-us)**<br>
The goal of this project is to develop a web map using R or Tableau to visualize crop yields in Iowa over time and identify factors that impact production such as soil quality and weather patterns. The project will use data analysis techniques to explore the correlation between crop yields and factors such as soil quality, weather patterns, and crop management practices. By creating a web map that displays crop yields across different counties in Iowa over time, the project aims to identify trends and patterns that could help farmers optimize their crop management practices. The project will also incorporate remote sensing technologies to monitor plant growth and health, as well as weather patterns, to predict pest and disease outbreaks and determine when and how much water to apply to different areas of the field.



**Xin Yan - [What data can help us estimate building heights at high resolution?](https://xinyan127.github.io/LA558_XinYan/?locale=en-us)**<br>
Building height is an important indicator for estimating energy consumption, material stock allocation, greenhouse gas emissions, urban heat island effects, distribution of population,and urban development plan. However, openly accessible building height information over large areas at high spatial resolution is still missing. To estimate the building height at a high accuracy, satellite data is the best choice to do that. Besides that, the building morphology also plays a big role. Different satellite data has various band setting, observation characteristics and research focus, the most important work is finding a set of stable features that help us build a model to estimate the building height. After having these features, we can easily predict the building height!
